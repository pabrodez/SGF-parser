# ðŸ“– SGF text parser
A SGF file parser written in Typescript

## About SGF specification
> SGF is the standard format for go (igo, weiqi, baduk) game records, and is also used for several other games. SGF is a text-only format (not a binary format). It contains game trees, with all their nodes and properties, and nothing more. Thus the file format reflects the regular internal structure of a tree of property lists. There are no exceptions; if a game needs to store some information on file with the document, a (game-specific) property must be defined for that purpose.
